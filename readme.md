Command-line version of Connect Four, playable by two players or vs computer.

The Connect Four game was developed using the principles of Test Driven Development (TDD), which follows the red-green-refactor cycle. The objective of TDD is to write tests that specify the desired behavior of the code, then implement the code to pass those tests. This approach promotes better code quality, maintainability, and test coverage.

## Problems

Implement the game logic to handle player turns, dropping pieces, and checking for a winning condition.
Design and create a 6x7 game board to store in memory, check for conditions, as well as display.
Ensure that only valid moves are allowed and prevent placing pieces in already occupied positions.
Implement the win condition logic to check for four connected pieces vertically, horizontall, and at both diagonals.

## What I Learned

- Understanding the importance of writing tests before writing code to ensure code correctness.
- Utilizing stubs and doubles to isolate methods and dependencies during testing.
- Improving code quality and maintainability by iteratively refactoring code based on tests. (Red-green-refactor cycle)
